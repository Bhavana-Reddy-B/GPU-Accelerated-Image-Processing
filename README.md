## 🧠 Overview

**GPU-Accelerated Image Processing Pipeline** is a high-performance image transformation and filtering project built using **OpenCV** with **CUDA** acceleration.  
It demonstrates how GPU computing can significantly speed up image operations like blurring, edge detection, color conversion, and resizing — especially for large batches of high-resolution images.

Originally developed for experimentation on Google Colab, this version refactors and extends the pipeline to benchmark **GPU vs CPU performance** for real-time image processing tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **GPU-Accelerated Processing:** Uses CUDA-enabled OpenCV functions for high-speed filtering and transformations.  
- 🧩 **Real-Time Comparison:** Benchmarks GPU vs CPU execution times for common image processing operations.  
- 🖼️ **Multi-Filter Support:** Includes operations such as Gaussian blur, edge detection, color space conversion, and thresholding.  
- 📊 **Performance Visualization:** Displays performance metrics and speedup ratios for each operation.  
- ☁️ **Colab Compatible:** Fully runnable in Google Colab with CUDA-enabled runtimes.

## 🧩 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhavana-Reddy-B/GPU-Accelerated-Image-Processing.git
cd GPU-Accelerated-Image-Processing
```

### 2️⃣ Set up environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Verify CUDA and OpenCV GPU support
```python
import cv2
print(cv2.getBuildInformation())
```
You should see `CUDA: YES` in the build info.

## ⚡ Usage

### Run on Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab.  
2. Set the runtime to **GPU** (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU).  
3. Execute all cells to compare CPU vs GPU processing speeds.

### Run locally
1. Ensure your system has an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers installed.  
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python gpu_image_processing.py
```
3. View generated output images and performance logs.
